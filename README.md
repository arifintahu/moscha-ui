# Moscha - Chatbot for Cosmos Chains

## Overview

Moscha is an interactive chatbot designed specifically for engaging with Cosmos chains. Our primary objective is to provide seamless and meaningful interactions for users. Recognizing that some users lack technical expertise, we aim to address any technical issues that may arise during their interactions with the chains. As a solution, we enable users to execute transactions and seek assistance through the chatbot.

## Roadmap

Stage 1 [**CURRENT**]

- Seamless UI interactions
- Interaction with simple transactions (send, delegate, undelegate)
- Interaction with straightforward queries (balance, staking)

Stage 2 [**PLAN**]

- Integration with additional chains
- Expansion of interaction capabilities (transactions and queries)

Stage 3 [**PLAN**]

- Integration with Cosmos knowledge
- Implementation of an assistance guide
- Integration with specific chain transactions and queries
